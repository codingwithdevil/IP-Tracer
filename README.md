### Notes:- 
    You will probably not know the exact physical address of an Internet device (mobile phone, computer, etc.), website, or the person you're trying to locate,
    but in most cases you will know the region (district), and very often accompanying details such as area, or metro, along with latitude and longtitude
    which is quite enough information when you are doing your own investigation and you also want to see those details on the visual map as well.
